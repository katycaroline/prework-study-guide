# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description 

This project was completed so I would have a study guide for my coding bootcamp. I built it so that I would have a better understanding of how to use HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, as well as learning several things about GitHub.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used to help me study the different things I have learned and am learning about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section contains notes about their respective topics. Opening the DevTools console enables me to see the JavaScript running, and it will list the above topics and choose one at random to study.

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
